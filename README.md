This is the [main website](https://cinder.cloud) for cindercloud. Cindercloud is a place where ICOs will be thoroughly investigated and where all information
that we found will be summarized.

If you'd like us to investigate an ICO, please create a ticket on github, message us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/cindercloudapp) or leave a message on one of our [blog posts](https://blog.cinder.cloud).
